# Quick Start Guide

This guide will walk you through the process of setting up and running a neural network demo from the Cortex Code Lab repository. Follow these steps for a smooth experience:

## Setting Up the Environment:

1. **Repository Cloning:** Start by cloning the repository from GitHub to your local system using the command:
```git clone https://github.com/realfishsam/Cortex-Code-Lab```

2. **Demo Directory Navigation:** Navigate to the demo directory with the command:
```cd Cortex-Code-Lab/demo```


## How to Use:

Engage with the neural network demo by:

- **Drawing on the Canvas:** Use your mouse to draw digits on the canvas.
- **Erasing Mistakes:** Right-click and drag to erase any errors.
- **Adjusting Brush Size:** Use the scroll wheel to change the brush size for more detailed input.
- **Resetting Canvas:** Click the 'reset' button to clear the canvas for a new drawing.

## Running the Demo:

After setting up, run the demo by:
